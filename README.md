## Machine Learning (Multi-Layer Perceptron) vs Chain Ladder: Claims Forecasting

This is a private proof-of-concept project exploring how simple machine learning models compare to classical Chain Ladder methods for forecasting ultimate insurance claims.

The pipeline generates synthetic claims triangle data, trains a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model on partial development data, and benchmarks its predictions against Chain Ladder estimates.

The project also includes a full AWS deployment for inference and visualization, integrating:

- üîÅ **Lambda** with a custom Docker image
- üß† **Model and scaler loading** from S3
- üîê **Secure infrastructure** using IAM and VPC
- üîç **Real-time monitoring** via CloudWatch
- üåê **Public inference endpoint** via API Gateway
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive web app** served from EC2 with Streamlit
- üì¶ **Containerized model code** with ECR

> **Note**: This project is for educational/demo purposes only and has not been reviewed for actuarial or regulatory rigor.


## üìÅ Structure

- `src/generate_data.py`: Creates synthetic insurance claims triangle data.
- `src/prepare_data.py`: Prepares input features and targets for ML training.
- `src/train_model.py`: Trains a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict residual-to-ultimate claims.
- `src/predict_model.py`: Generates ML predictions on the test set for evaluation.
- `src/chain_ladder.py`: Computes classical Chain Ladder forecasts for comparison.
- `src/plot_results.py`: Visualizes ML vs. Chain Ladder performance.
